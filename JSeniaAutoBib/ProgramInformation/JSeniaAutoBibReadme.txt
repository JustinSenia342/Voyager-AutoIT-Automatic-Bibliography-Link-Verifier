Intro:
       Hello Everyone! my name is Justin Senia, I was hired in as a student assistant in the cataloging department in Eastern Michigan university’s library,  my job was simple, I needed to put the correct stickers on books and check bibliography link validity in voyager (our cataloging system) . The sticker part was fine, after all, who doesn’t like stickers? But the task of checking link validity was extremely tedious and incredibly time consuming. The job assigned to me and many students before me consisted of entering in strings of 7 digit numbers (manually) one at a time, checking to see if the database entry even exists, mark down my findings if it doesn’t and then (if it did exist) to check the hyperlink associated with the particular entry to make sure it was going to the right place or if the desired address even exists. Needless to say, it is a very long, process when you to check over thousands of entries, so I decided I should make a program that will do all of this for me in order to save time, help job turnover in the department for future hires and finally get to practice some of the programming techniques I’ve been learning about both in school and outside of the classroom. 
       The result of which was a program that would utilize Microsoft word, Microsoft excel, firefox, adobe reader , textpad and voyager to automate the link checking procedure through a variety of alogrithms, workarounds and dependencies in order to create a final product that will not only check for correct verifiable links, but also for discrepancies in the database, and populate an excel spreadsheet with the results for easy viewing later. Now, if you are working at the EMU library, then you won’t need to do the setup because it’s already configured for you, so you can skip straight to “Video 9”, otherwise I highly advise anyone who wants to use this program to go through each of the videos to ensure the program will work satisfactorily for you and your place of business (or if you so desire, just follow the written walkthrough because it’s essentially a transcript of the same setup information).

future plans:
make it so that initial 856 locator terminates if no 856 or 96* is found
